    <AC_MiliraStew.description>No matter how fearless Milian is, there are times when her defense is breached; Even the proud sky elf Milira can be conquered at times, such as in this bowl of soup.\n The taste of this soup is not particularly outstanding, but when the colonizers drink it, a sense of achievement arises, and the troubles caused by Milian may disappear.\n There were many conflicts among colonizers regarding this food: some compared it to bird meat, while others said it was chicken.</AC_MiliraStew.description>
