    <AC_AntySauce.description>Originally created by the ant tribe amidst endless war and suffering. The enemies infused their lives into every drop of the sauce, carrying the scent of death and blood. Every bite of Anty Sauce evokes the cold cruelty and brutal bitterness of the abyssâ€”it is the embodiment of pain and the taste of endless war.\nHowever, it has an excellent flavor and is a great condiment, so even the innocent ant tribe cannot escape the fate of being turned into sauce.</AC_AntySauce.description>
