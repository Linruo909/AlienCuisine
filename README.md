## Q&A

- Q: Can I add or remove in the middle?
<br> A: Absolutely no problem, but I wouldn't recommend removing midway.

- Q: Is it compatible with Multiplayer?
<br> A: Currently, mostly XML functionality is used, so it may be compatible with multiplayer(i didnt test it :P).

- Q: What should I do if I think the values are unreasonable?
<br> A: I never thought they were reasonable either. If you have ideas on this, feel free to contact me, and we can exchange thoughts.

- Q: Will there be more content in the future?
<br> A: My imagination is limited, but if you have any ideas, leave a comment, and who knows, maybe I can implement it. (If you're a mod expert, feel free to create it directly without leaving a comment.)

- Q: Is there a specific order for sorting? Can it be automatically sorted?
<br> A: It needs to be placed below the compatible races, or you can use automatic sorting (which has a built-in order).
